# Checkers - May The Best Win

# Checkers with computer player logic

## This is a version of the checkers game written in python.
## You can play against the computer or another person.

## In a game against the computer, one should take into account the fact that the computer tries to check where it can move the pawn, 
## whether it can attack the player's pawn, and whether the player will not launch a counterattack.
